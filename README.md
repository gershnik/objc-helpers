## What's included? ##

The library is a collection of mostly independent header files. There is nothing to link with. Simply add these headers to your include path and include them as needed.

`sample` directory contains a sample that demonstrates the usage of main features.


### Convert ANY C++ callable to a block ###

With modern Clang compiler you can seamlessly convert C++ lambdas to blocks like this:
```c++
dispatch_async(someQueue, []() { 
    //do something
})
```
This works and works great but there are a few things that don't:
* You can only pass a *lambda* as a block, not any other kind of callable. For example this does not compile:
  ```cpp
  struct foo { void operator()() const {} };
  dispatch_async(someQueue, foo{});
  ```
* You cannot pass a *mutable* lambda this way. This doesn't compile either
  ```cpp
  dispatch_async(someQueue, []() mutable { 
     //do something
  });
  ```
  Neither cannot you pass a block that captures anything mutable (like your lambda) - captured variables are all const
* Your lambda captured variables are always *copied* into the block, not *moved*. If you have captures that are
  expensive to copy - oh well...
* Because of the above you cannot have move-only thinks in your block. Forget about using `std::unique_ptr` for example.

The `BlockUtils.h` header gives you an ability to solve all of these problems.

It provides two functions: `makeBlock` and `makeMutableBlock` that take any C++ callable as an input and return an object
that is implicitly convertible to a block and can be passed to any block-taking API. They (or rather the object they return)
have the following features:

* You can wrap any C++ callable, not just a lambda. 
* `makeBlock` returns a block that invokes `operator()` on a `const` callable and 
  `makeMutableBlock` returns a block that invokes it on a non-const one. Thus `makeMutableBlock` can be used with 
  mutable lambdas or any other callable that provides non-const `operator()`.
* If callable is movable it will be moved into the block, not copied. It will also be moved if the block is "copied to heap" 
  by ObjectiveC runtime or `Block_copy` in plain C++.
* It is possible to use move-only callables.
* All of this is accomplished with NO dynamic memory allocation
* This functionality is also available on Linux under CLang (see [Linux notes](#linux-notes) below).
  
Some examples of their usage are as follows:

```c++ 
//Convert any callable
struct foo { void operator()() const {} };
dispatch_async(someQueue, makeBlock(foo{})); //this moves foo in since it's a temporary

//Copy or move a callable in
foo callable;
dispatch_async(someQueue, makeBlock(callable));
dispatch_async(someQueue, makeBlock(std::move(callable)));

//Convert mutable lambdas
int captureMeByValue;
dispatch_async(someQueue, makeMutableBlock([=]() mutable { 
    captureMeByValue = 5; //the local copy of captureMeByValue is mutable
}));

//Use move-only callables
auto ptr = std::make_unique<SomeType>();
dispatch_async(someQueue, makeBlock([ptr=str::move(ptr)]() {
    ptr->someMethod();
}));

```

One important thing to keep in mind is that the object returned from `makeBlock`/`makeMutableBlock` **is the block**. It is NOT a block pointer (e.g. Ret (^) (args)) and it doesn't "store" the block pointer inside. The block's lifetime is this object's lifetime and it ends when this object is destroyed. You can copy/move this object around and invoke it as any other C++ callable.
You can also convert it to the block _pointer_ as needed either using implicit conversion or a `.get()` member function.
In ObjectiveC++ the block pointer lifetime is not-related to the block object's one. The objective C++ ARC machinery will do the 
necessary magic behind the scenes. For example:

```c++
//In ObjectiveC++
void (^block)(int) = makeBlock([](int){});
block(7); // this works even though the original block object is already destroyed
```

In plain C++ the code above would crash since there is no ARC magic. You need to manually manage block pointers lifecycle using
`copy` and `Block_release`. For example:
```c++
//In plain C++ 
void (^block)() = copy(makeBlock([](int){}));
block(7); //this works because we made a copy
Block_release(block);
```

`BlockUtil.h` also provides two helpers: `makeWeak` and `makeStrong` that simplify the "strongSelf" 
casting dance around avoiding circular references when using blocks/lambdas.

Here is the intended usage:

```objc++ 
dispatch_async(someQueue, [weakSelf = makeWeak(self)] () {
    auto self = makeStrong(weakSelf);
    if (!self)
        return;
    [self doSomething];
});
```

### Coroutines that execute on GCD dispatch queues ###

Header `CoDispatch.h` allows you to use **asynchronous** C++ coroutines that execute on GCD dispatch queues. Yes there is [this library](https://github.com/alibaba/coobjc) but it is big, targeting Swift and ObjectiveC rather than C++/\[Objective\]C++ and has a library to integrate with. It also has more features, of course. Here you get basic powerful C++ coroutine support in a single not very large (~800 loc) header.

Working with coroutines is discussed in greater detail in [a separate doc](doc/CoDispatch.md).

Here is a small sample of what you can do:

```objc++
DispatchTask<int> coro() {

    //this will execute asyncronously on the main queue
    int i = co_await co_dispatch([]() {
        return 7;
    });

    //you can specify a different queue of course
    auto queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND, 0);
    int j = co_await co_dispatch(queue, []() {
        return 42;
    }).resumeOnMainQueue(); //add this to resume back on main queue

    //you can convert ObjC APIs with asynchronous callbacks to couroutines
    auto status = co_await makeAwaitable<int>([](auto promise) {
        NSError * err;
        [NSTask launchedTaskWithExecutableURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/bin/bash"]
                                    arguments:@[@"-c", @"ls"]
                                        error:&err
                           terminationHandler:^(NSTask * res){
            promise.success(res.terminationStatus);
        }];
        if (err)
            throw std::runtime_error(err.description.UTF8String);
    }).resumeOnMainQueue();

    //this will switch execution to a different queue
    co_await resumeOn(queue);
}

//coroutines can await other corotines
DispatchTask<int> anotherCoro() {
    int res = co_await coro();

    co_return res;
}

//you can also have asynchronous generators
DispatchGenerator<std::string> generator() {
    co_yield "Hello";
    co_yield "World";
    //in real life you probably will use something like
    //co_yield co_await somethingAsync(); 
}

DispatchTask<int> useGenerator() {
    std::vector<std::string> dest;
    //this will run generator asynchrnously on the main queue
    for (auto it = co_await generator().begin(); it; co_await it.next()) {
        res.push_back(*it);
    }

    //you can also say things like
    //auto it = generator().resumingOnMainQueue().beginOn(queue)
    //to control the running and resuming queues
}

int main() {

    //fire and forget
    anotherCoro();
    useGenerator();

    dispatch_main();
}
```

This facility can also be used both from plain C++ (.cpp) and ObjectiveC++ (.mm) files. It is also available on Linux using [libdispatch][libdispatch] library (see [Linux notes](#linux-notes) below).


### Boxing of any C++ objects in ObjectiveC ones ###

Sometimes you want to store a C++ object where an ObjectiveC object is expected. Perhaps there is
some `NSObject * tag` which you really want to put an `std::vector` in or something similar. You can,
of course, do that by creating a wrapper ObjectiveC class that stores `std::vector` but it is a huge annoyance. Yet another ObjectiveC class to write (so a new header and a .mm file) lots of boilerplate code for `init` and value access and, after all that, it is going to to be `std::vector` specific. If you later need to wrap another C++ class you need yet another wrapper. 

For plain C structs ObjectiveC has a solution: `NSValue` that can store any C struct and let you retrieve it back later. Unfortunately in C++ this only works for "trivially copyable" types (which more or less correspond to "plain C structs"). Trying to stick anything else in `NSValue` will appear to work but likely do very bad things - it simply copies object bytes into it and out! Whether bytes copied out will work as the original object is undefined.

To solve this issue `BoxUtil.h` provides generic facilities for wrapping and unwrapping of any C++ object in an `NSObject`-derived classes without writing any code. Such wrapping and unwrapping of native objects in higher-level language ones are usually called "boxing" and "unboxing", hence the
name of the header and it's APIs. 

The only requirement for the C++ class to be wrappable is having a public destructor and at least one public constructor. The constructor doesn't need to be default - boxing works with objects that need to be "emplaced".

You use it like this:

```objc++
std::vector<int> someVector{1,2,3};
//this copies the vector into the wrapper
NSObject * obj1 = box(someVector);
//and this moves it
NSObject * obj2 = box(std::move(someVector));
//you can also do this
NSObject * obj3 = box(std::vector<int>{1,2,3});
//and you can emplace the object directly rather than copy or move it
NSObject * obj4 = box<std::vector<int>>(5, 3); //emplaces {3,3,3,3,3}

//You can get a reference to wrapped object
//This will raise an ObjectiveC exception if the type doesn't macth

auto & vec = boxedValue<std::vector<int>>(obj1);
assert(vec.size() == 3);
assert(vec[1] == 2);

The reference you get back is mutable by default. If you want immutability do this
NSObject * immuatbleObj = box<const std::vector<int>>(...any of the stuff above...);

//if your C++ object has a copy constructor the wrapper 
//will implement NSCopying
auto * obj5 = (NSObject *)[obj1 copy];

//this uses operator== if available, which it is
assert([obj1 isEqual:obj3]);

//and this uses std::hash if available
//it will raise an exception if you have operator== but not std::hash!
//as incositent equality and hashing is one of the most common ObjectiveC errors
auto hash = obj1.hash

//you can obtain a sensible description
//it will try to use:
//std::to_string 
//iostream << 
//fall back on "boxed object of type <name of the class>"

auto desc = obj1.description;

//if your object supports <=> operator that returns std::strong_ordering
//you can use compare: method
assert([box(5) compare:box(6)] == NSOrderingAscending);

```

### Comparators for ObjectiveC objects ###

Header `NSObjectUtil.h` provides `NSObjectEqual` and `NSObjectHash` - functors that evaluate equality and hash code for any NSObject and allow them to be used as keys in `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_set` for example. These are implemented in terms of `isEqual` and `hash` methods of `NSObject`. 

Header `NSStringUtil.h` provides `NSStringLess` and `NSStringLocaleLess` comparators. These allow `NSString` objects to be used as keys in `std::map` or `std::set `as well as used in STL sorting and searching algorithms. 

Additionally it provides `NSStringEqual` comparator. This is more efficient than `NSObjectEqual` and is implemented in terms of `isEqualToString`.

Header `NSNumberUtil.h` provides `NSNumberLess` comparator. This allows `NSNumber` objects to be used as keys in `std::map` or `std::set` as well as used in STL sorting and searching algorithms.  

Additionally it provides `NSNumberEqual` comparator. This is more efficient than `NSObjectEqual` and is implemented in terms of `isEqualToNumber`. 


For all comparators `nil`s are handled properly. A `nil` is equal to `nil` and is less than any non-`nil` object.

### Printing ObjectiveC objects to C++ streams and std::format ###

Header `NSObjectUtil.h` provides `operator<<` for any `NSObject` to print it to an `std::ostream`. This behaves similarly to `%@` formatting flag by delegating either to `descriptionWithLocale:` or to `description`.

Header `NSStringUtil.h` provides additional `operator<<` to print an `NSString` to an `std::ostream`. This outputs `UTF8String`.

Both headers also provide `std::formatter`s with the same functionality if `std::format` is available in the standard library and
`fmt::formatter` if a macro `NS_OBJECT_UTIL_USE_FMT` is defined. In the later case presence of `<fmt/format.h>` or `"fmt/format.h"` include file is required.


### Accessing NSString/CFString as a char16_t container ###

Header `NSStringUtil.h` provides `NSStringCharAccess` - a fast accessor for `NSString` characters (as `char16_t`) via an STL container interface. This uses approach similar to [`CFStringInlineBuffer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cfstringinlinebuffer?language=objc) one. This facility can be used both from ObjectiveC++ and plain C++.

Here are some examples of usage

```cpp

for (char16_t c: NSStringCharAccess(@"abc")) {
    ...
}

std::ranges::for_each(NSStringCharAccess(@"abc") | std::views::take(2), [](char16_t c) {
    ...
});
```

Note that `NSStringCharAccess` is a _reference class_ (akin in spirit to `std::string_view`). It does not hold a strong reference to the `NSString`/`CFString` it uses and is only valid as long as that string exists.

### Conversions between `NSString`/`CFString` and `char`/`char16_t`/`char32_t`/`char8_t`/`wchar_t` ranges

Header `NSStringUtil.h` provides `makeNSString` and `makeCFString` functions that accept:
* Any contiguous range of Chars (including `std::basic_string_view`, `std::basic_string`, `std::span` etc. etc.)
* A pointer to a null-terminated C string of Chars
* An `std::initializer_list<Char>`

where Char can be any of `char`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`, `char8_t`, `wchar_t`

and converts it to `NSString`/`CFString`. They return `nil` on failure.

Conversions from `char16_t` are exact and can only fail when out of memory. Conversions from other formats will fail also when encoding is invalid. Conversions from `char` assume UTF-8 and from `wchar_t`, UTF-32. 

To convert in the opposite direction the header provides `makeStdString<Char>` overloads. These accept:

* `NSString *`/`CFStringRef`, optional start position (0 by default) and optional length (whole string by default)
* A pair of `NSStringCharAccess` iterators
* Any range of `NSStringCharAccess` iterators

They return an `std::basic_string<Char>`. A `nil` input produces an empty string.  Similar to above conversions from `char16_t` are exact and conversions to other char types transcode from an appropriate UTF encoding. If the source `NSString *`/`CFStringRef` contains invalid UTF-16 the output is an empty string.

This functionality is available in both ObjectiveC++ and plain C++

### XCTest assertions for C++ objects ###

When using XCTest framework you might be tempted to use `XCTAssertEqual` and similar on C++ objects. While this works and works safely you will quickly discover that when the tests fail you get a less than useful failure message that shows _raw bytes_ of the C++ object instead of any kind of logical description. This happens because in order to obtain the textual description of the value `XCTAssertEqual` and friends stuff it into an `NSValue` and then query its description. And, as mentioned in [BoxUtil.h](#boxutilh) section, `NSValue` simply copies raw bytes of a C++ object. 

While this is still safe, because nothing except the description is ever done with those bytes the end result is hardly usable. To fix this `XCTestUtil.h` header provides the following replacement macros:

- `XCTAssertCppEqual`
- `XCTAssertCppNotEqual`
- `XCTAssertCppGreaterThan`
- `XCTAssertCppGreaterThanOrEqual`
- `XCTAssertCppLessThan`
- `XCTAssertCppLessThanOrEqual`

That, in the case of failure, try to obtain description using the following methods:

- If there is an ADL call `testDescription(obj)` that produces `NSString *`, use that.
- Otherwise, if there is an ADL call `to_string(obj)` in `using std::to_string` scope, use that
- Otherwise, if it is possible to do `ostream << obj`, use that
- Finally produce `"<full name of the type> object"` string.

Thus if an object is printable using the typical means those will be automatically used. You can also make your own objects printable using either of the means above. The `testDescription` approach specifically exists to allow you to print something different for tests than in normal code.

## Linux notes ##

`BlockUtil.h` and `CoDispatch.h` headers can also be used on Linux. Currently this requires 
* CLang 16 or above (for blocks support). See [this issue][gcc-blocks] for status of blocks support in GCC
* [swift-corelibs-libdispatch][libdispatch] library. Note that **most likely you need to build it from sources**. The versions available via various package managers (as of summer 2024) are very old and cannot be used.

You must use:
```
--std=c++20 -fblocks
```
flags to use these headers.

For `CoDispatch.h` link with:
```
-ldispatch -lBlocksRuntime
```

For `BlockUtil.h` link with:
```
-lBlocksRuntime
```
